Line 126: Failing build: Failed to build site

Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed because the deploy directory 'client/dist' does not exist as specified in the configuration.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the 'client/dist' directory exists in the project.
2. If the directory does not exist, create it in the project and ensure it contains the files to be deployed.
3. Update the publish directory path in the Netlify configuration to point to the correct location of the build output.
4. After making the changes, re-run the build to deploy the site successfully.
